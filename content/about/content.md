# The problem

If we’re to hit the Paris and Katowice targets to address climate change, we must scale up the way we fund projects that move us closer towards success. We believe that a major barrier to achieving scale is that the underlying data around sustainability scoring is challenging to obtain and process.

# The lab and the team

We’re a team of two, working at an early stage out of [ING Labs London](https://www.ing.com/About-us/ING-Labs.htm) to investigate the problem and find potential solutions.

We're [Stef Lewandowski](Stef Lewandowski) and [Tee Pruitt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teepruitt).
